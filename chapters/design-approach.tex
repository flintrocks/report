\section{Our Approach}

Starting from the existing codebase, our aim was to maintain consistency as much as possible, while adding our own features and improving the compiler where necessary. As such, we have kept the infrastructure described above and added our own AST node classes and AST passes, as well as extending  the existing passes. 

Most of the features we have implemented can be grouped into two categories: improving the language and IDE integration. We have also added unit testing and enhanced the code generation.

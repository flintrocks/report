## Dependencies

A LaTeX / `pdflatex` installation is necessary. The [`minted`](https://github.com/gpoore/minted) package needs to be installed for the syntax highlighting to work. Note that `minted` also depends on `python`, and the Python `pygments` module (`pip install pygments`).

## Building

```bash
$ ./build.sh
```

Output is in `cw.pdf`.
